# mini-project
Welcome ro my Mini Project presentation!
I have created a fun and interactive Simon Says Game ,built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This project is inpired by a classic memory game where players must repeat an every increasing sequence of colors and sounds.
the game tests your memory and concentration in a playful way.
